### Welcome to My GitHub! 🌟

Hi there! 

I'm Melanie, a data enthusiast with a passion for translating complex data into actionable insights and eye-catching dashboards. With a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Statistics, and over 5 years of hands-on experience in BI, data engineering and analytics practices, I've worked across various domains to drive data-driven decision-making and foster cross-functional collaboration.

### Who Am I? 🤔

I am currently a full-time Senior Business Intelligence Analyst at a tech company called, Medallia working on integrations and data analytics, and I am also a data consultant for the Crimson Community Mentorship Program (CCMP) in my hometown of Everett, MA helping the team use data to build a data-driven matching algorithm process for the mentors/mentees to help better understand their wants/needs. During my career journey, I have pioneered data initiatives for VC-backed startups keen on harnessing their data but lacking specialized expertise and I have also collaborated in established, larger teams. Aside from working with data, I also love taking long walks with my dog and enjoying nature when I can! I love talking as much as I love analyzing, so please feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat :)
