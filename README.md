### Welcome to My GitHub! 🌟

Hi there! 

I'm Melanie, a data enthusiast with a passion for translating complex data into actionable insights and eye-catching dashboards. With a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Statistics, and over 5 years of hands-on experience in BI, data engineering and analytics practices, I've worked across various domains to drive data-driven decision-making and foster cross-functional collaboration.

### Who Am I? 🤔

I am currently a consultant at La Comunidad, a non-profit based in my hometown of Everett, MA assisting and analyzing political survey data to help BIPOC residents of Everett, MA gain the resources they need to live a more financially stable life. I am also a data consultant for Everett's Crimson Community Mentorship Program (CCMP), helping the team use data to build a data-driven matching algorithm process for the mentors/mentees and to better understand their wants/needs. I have worked as a Senior BI/Data Analyst and Data Scientist for VC-backed startups keen on harnessing their data but lacking specialized expertise and I have also collaborated with data operations in established, larger teams. During my career journey, I have had the opportunity to pioneer data initiatives and contribute to growing teams. Aside from data, I also love taking long walks with my dog and enjoying nature when I can! I am currently seeking my next opportuinity to challenge the boundaries of my analytical skills and grow as a data professional, so please feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat :)
